#Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.
# variables can be assigned value with the help of assignment operator.
# data types you can store are integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
#Python has data types −Numbers,String,List,Tuple,Dictionary that can also be stored using a variable
# eg. a=2 ,b=2.0 , c= "data science" ,d=  [123, 'john'] ,e= ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john') ,f ={'name': 'john', 'dept': 'sales', 'code': 6734}

#type conversion functions can be used to directly convert one data type to another
#There are two types of Type Conversion in Python: Implicit Type Conversion ,Explicit Type Conversion
# implicit type conversion: Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without any user involvement.
#eg:
x = 10
print("x is of type:",type(x))
  
y = 10.6
print("y is of type:",type(y))
  
z = x + y
  
print(z)
print("z is of type:",type(z))


# In[6]:


#Explicit type conversion :the data type is manually changed by the user as per the requirement.
#eg:
s = 'geeks'
  
# printing string converting to tuple
c = tuple(s)
print ("After converting string to tuple : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing string converting to set
c = set(s)
print ("After converting string to set : ",end="")
print (c)
  
# printing string converting to list
c = list(s)
print ("After converting string to list : ",end="")
print (c)

# We can write a python script in notepad and save as "filename.py" (with python file extension)
#To execute script from command line
#To run the script,you can call the Python program from the Command Prompt and tell it which file to execute. 
# From the Command Prompt, simply type: python filename.py 
#(type in the word ‘python’ followed by the name of the python file)

#A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number. A complex number is of the form a + ib and is usually represented by z.
#In python,complex numbers are represented using the “complex” data type, which consists of a “real” and an “imaginary” component which is represented by j
#To create the complex number “2 + 3j”, write the following code statement:
z = complex(2, 3)
print(z)
